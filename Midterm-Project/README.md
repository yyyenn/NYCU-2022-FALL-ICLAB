### Midterm Project - Erosion, Dilation and Histogram Equalization

Design a digital image processing circuit for the pictures stored in DRAM fetched via AXI-4 protocol. Implement Erosion, Dilation, and Histogram equalization.

Need to understand AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) and how to implement DRAM through AXI 4 Handshaking Process.

The design is divided into three layers: **DRAM/SRAM/REG** architecture
