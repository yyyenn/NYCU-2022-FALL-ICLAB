### Lab04 - Recurrent Neural Network

RNN stands for Recurrent Neural Network, which is a type of artificial neural network that has connections between nodes that form a directed or undirected graph along a temporal sequence.

Implemnet a Recurrent Neural Network using the concept of pipeline and Synopsys DesignWare IP.

And then, optimize the design by selecting a suitable size of SRAM, and sharing registers.
