### Lab09 - food delivery platform

We'll create iclab-Eats, a food delivery platform for NYCU students, where everyone is a system controller and follows instructions for food pickup, ordering, and delivery from iclab-Eats.

The most distinctive aspect is that we have designed this circuit using **System Verilog**.
