### Lab10 - SV PATTERN & CHECKER(Assertion)
 
Design a food delivery platform by System Verilog. Verify the design by using constrained-random testing to simulate a wide range of scenarios and edge cases.

Writing a System Verilog verification, the requirements are based on the guidelines provided in Lab09. 

The goals are to achieve better performance and 100% coverage, minimize the number of required cycles and patterns, and design the DRAM's initial state to ensure that each case can be executed with minimal repetitions.
