### Final Project - Morphology and Histogram Equalization

Based on the midterm project, we will be implementing a morphology processing unit that contains five different operations. 

Three of these operations are the same as those in the midterm project: erosion, dilation, and histogram equalization. 

The other two operations are opening and closing. 

Opening is a grayscale erosion followed by grayscale dilation, and closing is a grayscale dilation followed by grayscale erosion.

**The design will be done from RTL to APR.**
