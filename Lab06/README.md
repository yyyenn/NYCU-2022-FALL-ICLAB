### Lab06 - Unix timestamp

The Unix timestamp or UNIX Epoch time is a system that represents a specific moment in time as the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1st, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.   
This reference point remains constant irrespective of the user's location.

Design a device that can convert Unix time into a readable date and time format during each cycle in the top-level design. 

Additionally, develop a custom **soft IP** to showcase the results in binary-coded decimal (BCD) code.
