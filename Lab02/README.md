### Lab02 - find the shortest path 

Creating a circuit that can identify the shortest possible path requires a thorough understanding of sequential circuits and Finite State Machines (FSM). 

The primary objective is to design a circuit that can accomplish this task. To achieve this, it is necessary to utilize both sequential and combinational circuits in order to implement a shortest path algorithm that bears similarity to the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
